# Contributing-to-Nixpkgs-in-the-BioNix-Project
As one of the first acts of active contribution in the BioNix project, you will be tasked with wrapping and testing the following bioinformatics software into the [Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs):
* [TRF]()
* [RepeatMasker](https://github.com/WEHI-ResearchComputing/BioNix-GettingStarted/wiki/4.2-RepeatMasker)
* [Kraken2](https://github.com/WEHI-ResearchComputing/BioNix-GettingStarted/wiki/4.1-Kraken2)

These are listed in order of estimated difficulty and so your team should begin with TRF if not feeling too confident. Approaching Kraken2 will require additional initiative, as currently there are no tests provided to check that workflows ensure data reproducibility.
