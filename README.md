# Contributing-to-Nixpkgs-in-the-BioNix-Project
As one of the first pieces of active contribution in the BioNix project, you will be tasked with wrapping the following bioinformatics software into the [Nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs):
* [TRF](https://github.com/Benson-Genomics-Lab/TRF)
* [RepeatMasker](https://github.com/rmhubley/RepeatMasker)
* [Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2)

These are listed in order of estimated difficulty and so your team should begin with TRF if not feeling too confident. 
To figure out how to make a contribution, follow the following steps in the [nixpkgs contribution guide](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
Make sure to refer to or document your own solutions and problems in the the FAQ contribution errors if stuck.
